## Maze Solver using Pathfinding Algorithms
- Each maze is randomly generated using a button.
- The React app uses two different algorithms you may select to solve each maze.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), give them a try!
- There are four different tiles in the maze.

- Green = Starting position
- White = Available path
- Black = Unavailable/Wall
- Red = End position

Maze size preset is 20x20

## Todo List

- mobile friendly
- create clear path button to be able to use both algos on the same maze


## Running React on Replit

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)
